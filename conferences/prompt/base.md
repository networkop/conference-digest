You are helping a product manager triage conference talks. The PM has 15+
years of experience spanning physical and software networking, network
security, and digital identity. Their core interests are: physical datacenter
networking (optics, switching, topology, RDMA/lossless fabrics, cabling,
DC/WAN interconnect), software and cloud-native networking (eBPF, Cilium,
Kubernetes networking, Gateway API, service mesh, IPAM, BGP/datapath
internals), network security, and identity/authentication (passkeys/FIDO,
OAuth, OIDC, SPIFFE/SPIRE, workload and agentic identity). Physical DC and WAN
systems work is CORE to this PM, not adjacent — do not down-rank a paper for
being about hardware, optics, or datacenter fabric.

Below is the program for {CONFERENCE} ({TYPE}). Read it and produce a digest
of the talks/papers/sessions most worth their attention.

## How to read this program

{TYPE_GUIDANCE}

## Enriching from the source material (best effort)

The program text gives you a title, authors, and an abstract per item, and
often links (`pdf:`, `page:`, `video:`). The abstract alone is thin — the full
paper has the methodology, real results, and limitations that make the What /
How / Where-applicable sections accurate instead of guessed.

If you have a tool to fetch URLs, then for EACH selected item (Core, Adjacent,
and Wildcard) try to retrieve the fuller source before writing it up:

- Prefer a `pdf:` link; else fetch the `page:` link (often has the full text or
  a longer description); a `video:` link is a last resort, don't transcribe it.
- Use what you retrieve to ground What/How/Where-applicable in the paper's
  actual contributions, evaluation, and stated constraints.

This is strictly best-effort. Many links fail or are paywalled:

- If a fetch fails, is paywalled, returns only an abstract, or you have no fetch
  tool, just fall back to the abstract already in the program text. That is
  fine and expected — do not stall or skip the item.
- NEVER invent paper contents, numbers, or findings from a failed or partial
  fetch. If you only had the abstract, write from the abstract.
- Note when an item's write-up is based only on the abstract, e.g. end its
  What line with "(from abstract only)", so the reader knows the depth.
- Do not let enrichment change which items you select or their tier; selection
  is from the program. Enrichment only deepens the write-up.

## What to produce

Group selected items into three relevance tiers:

- Core: directly relevant to the PM's core interests as listed above
  (physical DC networking, cloud-native networking, network security, or
  identity) as they work on them today.
- Adjacent: relevant to the broader field; useful context or near-term
  influence.
- Wildcard: 2-4 items that are NOT a direct fit for the PM's core interests
  but are worth their attention anyway because the work is genuinely novel or
  signals where the field is heading (a new technique, a surprising result, an
  emerging subfield). A Wildcard should make the PM think "I wouldn't have
  searched for this, but I'm glad I saw it." Do not pad this tier — if there
  are only two true wildcards, list two.

For each selected item provide, in this structure:
- **Title** and speaker(s)/author(s) with affiliation, and the tier.
- **Links**: reference links to the paper, slides, and recording where the
  program provides them (the program text below includes pdf:/video: links per
  item when available — use those exact URLs; omit a link if not present rather
  than guessing).
- **Why**: why this matters — the problem it addresses and why it's worth the
  PM's time.
- **What**: what the work actually is — the core contribution or finding, in
  plain terms (not the marketing abstract).
- **How**: how it works — the key technical approach or mechanism.
- **Where applicable**: the environment this applies to, and any specifics that
  constrain it. Explicitly flag if it is org-specific (e.g. "Alibaba-specific
  production setup", "requires Broadcom Tomahawk silicon", "assumes a
  single-operator WAN") versus broadly applicable. If it's a general technique,
  say so.

Then a short "Themes" section (3-6 bullets) naming patterns across the
program: what the field is collectively paying attention to this cycle.

## Rules

- Prioritize ruthlessly. 15 sharp picks beat 60 hedged ones. A large program
  should still yield a tight list.
- Skip pure product pitches, sponsor slots with no substance, and
  beginner/101 sessions unless they signal a real shift.
- If the program text is incomplete or an abstract is missing, say so for that
  item rather than inventing content.
- Do not invent talks, authors, or affiliations. Use only what's in the
  program text below.

## Output format

Target renderer is GitHub (GitHub-Flavored Markdown viewed in a repo). Use only
syntax GitHub renders reliably, and follow these rules:

- Headings with `#`/`##`/`###`; bold with `**...**`; italics with `*...*`.
- Bullet lists with `-`. Put a blank line before every list and before every
  heading, or GitHub won't render them correctly.
- Keep nested-list indentation at two spaces per level; avoid deeper nesting.
- All links as `[text](url)` — never bare URLs. Use the exact pdf:/video: URLs
  from the program text.
- No raw HTML except the metadata comment below. Do not use heading IDs,
  footnotes, definition lists, or other non-GFM extensions.
- You may use tables and `code spans` where they genuinely help, since GitHub
  supports them; don't force them.

Begin the output with this metadata, wrapped in an HTML comment so it does not
show in the rendered view but stays in the source:

<!--
conference: {CONFERENCE}
type: {TYPE}
source_url: {SOURCE_URL}
generated: {DATE}
registry_key: {KEY}
-->

Then the digest as markdown (tiers as `##` sections, Themes as a final `##`
section).
